Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```","errors":{"InvalidInitialization()":[{"details":"The contract is already initialized."}],"NotInitializing()":[{"details":"The contract is not initializing."}]},"events":{"Initialized(uint64)":{"details":"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized."}},"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"gasEstimates":null,"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.28+commit.7893614a\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"InvalidInitialization\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"NotInitializing\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":false,\"internalType\":\"uint64\",\"name\":\"version\",\"type\":\"uint64\"}],\"name\":\"Initialized\",\"type\":\"event\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow\":\"constructor constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy.

SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\n// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v5.3.0) (proxy/utils/Initializable.sol)\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.8.20;\\n\\n/**\\n * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\\n * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```solidity\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n *\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Storage of the initializable contract.\\n     *\\n     * It's implemented on a custom ERC-7201 namespace to reduce the risk of storage collisions\\n     * when using with upgradeable contracts.\\n     *\\n     * @custom:storage-location erc7201:openzeppelin.storage.Initializable\\n     */\\n    struct InitializableStorage {\\n        /**\\n         * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n         */\\n        uint64 _initialized;\\n        /**\\n         * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n         */\\n        bool _initializing;\\n    }\\n\\n    // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256(\\\"openzeppelin.storage.Initializable\\\")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))\\n    bytes32 private constant INITIALIZABLE_STORAGE = 0xf0c57e16840df040f15088dc2f81fe391c3923bec73e23a9662efc9c229c6a00;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev The contract is already initialized.\\n     */\\n    error InvalidInitialization();\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev The contract is not initializing.\\n     */\\n    error NotInitializing();\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint64 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.
